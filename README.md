In order to simplify the sharing and understanding of scripts, let’s keep to a few simple rules:
-	Push “final” products to a new organization repository.
-	Name repository in plain English. Let us know what the scripts do, briefly.
-	Always initiate repositories with README file and explain purpose of scripts there.
-	If you scripts require a specific directory structure, please mimic that in the organization repository.




If you are adding to the ‘Land of Misfit Scripts’ repository, special rules apply:
1.	Click ‘Upload files’ and make a new directory for your scripts by saving the directory name followed by  a ‘/’ … Github will know what to do with that
2.	In the new directory, upload your files with the appropriate file structure to ensure the reproducible examples work for others
3.	Manually add a README.md file to explain the purpose of the scripts.
   -	In the directory -> Upload files
   -	Name said file README.md, the .md file extension is critical
   -	Leave your detailed instructions/use for the script and save the commit
   -	The new .md should appear below the file structure of the new directory
 




In case you are not familiar with GitHub, here are some helpful tips to get you started with git for version control:
-	Read article https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4945047/ 
-	Set up github locally and start using it if you aren’t already:
   o	Good instructions: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html
   o	Great instructions, but maybe more than you want to know: http://happygitwithr.com/ 
-	Commit often
-	Push regularly to your local repository




Happy coding!
